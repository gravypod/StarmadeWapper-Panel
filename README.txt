Web CP:
	
	The Web CP is a built in control panel for the StarmadeWrapper. 
	It currently only shows in-game chat, allows you to stop, restart, start, and kill the server, and tells you if the server is online. The panel will later allow configuration of the StarmadeWrapper.
	I am also looking into the possibility of creating a starmade config editor.
	
	Notes:
		1. The panel by default is on
		2. The default port is 453
		3. The password is randomly generated
